/**
 * When managing IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity. This resource is to add iam policy bindings to a service account resource **to configure permissions for who can edit the service account**. To configure permissions for a service account to act as an identity that can manage other GCP resources, use the googleProjectIam set of resources.
 *
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a service account. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service account and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service account are preserved.
 * * `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the service account are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding` and `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.serviceAccount.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Secret Manager Secret. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the secret and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the secret are preserved.
 * * `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the secret are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamBinding` and `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.secretmanager.SecretIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

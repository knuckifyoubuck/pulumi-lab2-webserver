/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Compute Engine Instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
 * * `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMBinding` and `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.compute.InstanceIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

/**
 * An environment for running orchestration tasks.
 *
 * Environments run Apache Airflow software on Google infrastructure.
 *
 * To get more information about Environments, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/reference/rest/)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs)
 *     * [Configuring Shared VPC for Composer Environments](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/managing/configuring-shared-vpc)
 * * [Apache Airflow Documentation](http://airflow.apache.org/)
 *
 * > **Warning:** We **STRONGLY** recommend  you read the [GCP guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to)
 *   as the Environment resource requires a long deployment process and involves several layers of GCP infrastructure,
 *   including a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud Storage, and Compute networking resources. Due to limitations of the API,
 *   This provider will not be able to automatically find or manage many of these underlying resources. In particular:
 *   * It can take up to one hour to create or update an environment resource. In addition, GCP may only detect some
 *     errors in configuration when they are used (e.g. ~40-50 minutes into the creation process), and is prone to limited
 *     error reporting. If you encounter confusing or uninformative errors, please verify your configuration is valid
 *     against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs against this provider.
 *   * **Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that do not get cleaned up automatically** on environment
 *     deletion. [More about Composer's use of Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage).

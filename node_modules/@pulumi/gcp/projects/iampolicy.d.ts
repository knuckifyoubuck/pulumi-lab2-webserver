/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a project. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the project and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the project are preserved.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the project are preserved.
 * * `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMBinding`, `gcp.projects.IAMMember`, or `gcp.projects.IAMAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.projects.IAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.projects.IAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

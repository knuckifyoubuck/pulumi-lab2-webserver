/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud Endpoints Service. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the service and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the service are preserved.
 * * `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the service are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamBinding` and `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.endpoints.ServiceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

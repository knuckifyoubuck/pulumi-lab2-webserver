/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Artifact Registry Repository. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the repository and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the repository are preserved.
 * * `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the repository are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamBinding` and `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.artifactregistry.RepositoryIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

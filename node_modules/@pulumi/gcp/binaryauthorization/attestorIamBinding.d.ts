/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Binary Authorization Attestor. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the attestor and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the attestor are preserved.
 * * `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the attestor are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamBinding` and `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.binaryauthorization.AttestorIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

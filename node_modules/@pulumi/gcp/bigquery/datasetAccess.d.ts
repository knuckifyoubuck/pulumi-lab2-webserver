 * Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where

 * `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.
 *
 * > **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `gcp.bigquery.Dataset` resource, the
 * dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
 * `ignoreChanges = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.

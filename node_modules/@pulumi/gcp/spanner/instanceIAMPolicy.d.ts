/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 *
 * > **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your instance using `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMPolicy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMBinding` and `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.InstanceIAMMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
